<p class="box"> This is paragraph is to test Over flow.When we mess with the width, height and other similar properties then sometimes we face overflow. To control overflow we use property Overflow.  </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="boxVisible"> Fisrt thing we are gonna try is visible. Actaully it's the defaul value of overflow and doesn't fix the problem of overflow.  </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="boxHidden"> Overflow Hidden hides the content out of box. If I wrote another words you wont see. </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="boxScroll"> Overflow scroll hides the content out of box but adds a scrolling bar to view remaining content in the box.When you scroll down you can see the remaining contents. This comes in handy in many situations.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="boxAuto">The value Auto is same as scroll but it hides the scrolling when there's no overflow. This is also very usefull in many sitaution.</p>
